Modeling the ephaptic effect of the brain in artifical neural networks

The brain, a product of nature, is arguably the best computational device we have ever come
across. It stands unmatched in terms of fast intuitive learning, social intelligence, and
generation of unique and unpredictable chains of thought. Thus, it makes sense for artificial
intelligence researchers to seek inspiration from how the brain works and find out if
replicating phenomena in the brain makes their machine learning models perform better.

This project represents an effort along the lines mentioned above. We model a phenomenon,
known as ephaptic effect, in artificial neural networks to investigate if performance improves,
worsens or stays the same. We explore different ways of implementing this effect, and we
combine this phenomenon with known machine learning strategies to test how performance
varies.

Nomenclature:

add: ephaptic effect is added

sub: ephaptic effect is subtracted

same: neurons in the penultimate fully connected layer couple with each other

inter: neurons in the first fully connected layer couple with neurons in the second fully connected layer
